Bugs
- Players getting ball ontop of each other
- Ball visual being blocked when a player is on top of it
- Movements are not scaled so sometimes they move too fast for hitbox to register
- Ball is able to be shot before the player reaches it
    - The ball may be shot on stage 2 before the player reaches it
    - Especially when the ball is on ground and the player runs to it and shoots

Improvements

- Need to fix player sizes being displayed properly
    - add a box for hitbox
- Need to add player speed and power towards shots and movements
    - Scale the time it takes to move and shoot
- Ending screen
- Status bar
    - Notify steals and things done
